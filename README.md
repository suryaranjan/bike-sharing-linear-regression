# Bike Sharing - Linear Regrassion
Building a multiple linear regression model for the prediction of demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables.


## Table of Contents
# Analysing demand for shared bikes:
This model will be used by the management to understand how exactly the demands vary with different features.
Using this model they can manipulate the business strategy to meet the demand levels and meet the customer's expectations.


## General Information
Creating a function to find the total null count and null percentage 
analysis of the categorical variables from the dataset
validate the assumptions of Linear Regression after building the model on the training set



## Conclusions
The year box plots indicates that more bikes are rent during 2019.
The season box plots indicates that more bikes are rent during fall season.
The working day and holiday box plots indicate that more bikes are rent during normal working days than on weekends or holidays.
The month box plots indicates that more bikes are rent during september month.
The weekday box plots indicates that more bikes are rent during saturday.
The weathersit box plots indicates that more bikes are rent during Clear, F
There should be a linear and additive relationship between dependent (response) variable and independent (predictor) variable(s). There should be no correlation between the residual (error) terms. The independent variables should not be correlated. The error terms must have constant variance.
